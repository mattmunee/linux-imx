make -j4

Build device tree only:
make -j4 magi_mpuprotoboard.dtb

Build zImage only:
$ make -j4  zImage

Build modules only:
$ make -j4  modules

Build device trees only:
$ make -j4 dtbs

Copy kernel to SD using the following commands:
cp arch/arm/boot/zImage /media/mattmunee/BOOT-MAGI
sudo make ARCH=arm modules_install INSTALL_MOD_PATH=/media/mattmunee/rootfs
cp arch/arm/boot/dts/magi_mpuprotoboard.dtb /media/mattmunee/BOOT-MAGI

To load bq27426 kernel module, execute the following:
$ echo bq27426 0x55 > /sys/bus/i2c/devices/i2c-1/new_device

To unload the module:
$ echo 0x55 > /sys/bus/i2c/devices/i2c-1/delete_device

When module is loaded, sysfs entry appears at
/sys/class/power_supply/bq27426-0

Linux kernel
============

This file was moved to Documentation/admin-guide/README.rst

Please notice that there are several guides for kernel developers and users.
These guides can be rendered in a number of formats, like HTML and PDF.

In order to build the documentation, use ``make htmldocs`` or
``make pdfdocs``.

There are various text files in the Documentation/ subdirectory,
several of them using the Restructured Text markup notation.
See Documentation/00-INDEX for a list of what is contained in each file.

Please read the Documentation/process/changes.rst file, as it contains the
requirements for building and running the kernel, and information about
the problems which may result by upgrading your kernel.
